Installation
------------

If you have the GSL installed, just unpack the library with a command
like:

tar xvfz gdagsim-0.1.tgz

Change into the "src" directory, have a look at the Makefile, and
tweak anything that doesn't look quite right. Then try making the
library with:

make test

If all goes well, all of the source files should compile, including a
test program which should run, and finish with the message "All tests
passed.". If it doesn't, then you need to fix stuff until it does -
there's no point going any further until this works.

To build the dynamic library, do:

make gdag.so

If this doesn't work, you may need to hack the Makefile.

Next set the LIBPATH in the Makefile to be somewhere in your library
path where you want the library installing (/usr/lib might be a good
choice). Then, as "root", do:

make install

You might also need to:

ldconfig

To test your installation, do:

make libtest

If the library test builds, runs and passes, CONGRATULATIONS! You have
a working library. If not, some more hacking is required - you could
try manually setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the
path of the library.

See the documentation for information on how to use the library once
you have it working. There are also some example files in the
"examples" directory for practical illustrations of the use of the
library.
